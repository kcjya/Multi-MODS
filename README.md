## Introduce
Multi-model object detection system is hereinafter referred to as: Multi-MODS, a detection platform written in Pyqt and running on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. It is a multi-functional software for object detection. Multi-MODS realizes the integration of visual model training, detection, video detection, simple rule object size measurement and other functions. In addition, the software provides email notifications, TCP connection alarms, etc.
