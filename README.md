## Introduce
Multi-model object detection system is hereinafter referred to as: Multi-MODS, a detection platform written in Pyqt and running on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. It is a multi-functional software for object detection. Multi-MODS realizes the integration of visual model training, detection, video detection, simple rule object size measurement and other functions. In addition, the software provides email notifications, TCP connection alarms, etc.

## Feature
- Fast switching recognition model, suitable for multi-domain and multi-disciplinary object recognition.
- Image calibration, training, and detection are integrated, and a visual interface for training progress is provided.
- Wide range of applications: disaster monitoring, object recognition, defect detection, feature detection, and regular part size detection.
- Interface introduction, simple operation, multi-process technology, farewell interface card.
